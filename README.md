# GraphQL Workshop

Welcome to the GraphQL Workshop repository. This repository contains the materials and code for the GraphQL workshop.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop is designed to teach you how to work with GraphQL. Over the course of the workshop, you will learn how to create and use GraphQL endpoints.

### Day 1: Creating a Query Endpoint

On the first day, we will focus on creating a GraphQL endpoint for queries. You will learn how to:

- Set up a GraphQL server
- Define a schema
- Create resolvers for queries
- Test your GraphQL endpoint

## Getting Started

To get started with the workshop, clone this repository and follow the instructions in the `Workshop-01` folder.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- .NET 8 SDK

## Running the Code

To run the code for Day 1, navigate to the `Workshop-01` folder and install the dependencies:

cd Workshop-01 dotnet restore

Then, start the GraphQL server:

dotnet run

You can now access the GraphQL endpoint at `https://localhost:7051/graphql/`.
